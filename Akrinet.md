Biographies
===========

**Marios Dardas** (*Main Leader & Developer*): Data & Software Engineer
at J.P. Morgan.

**Anastassios Dardas** (*Designer & Co-developer*): Currently a 3rd year
PhD student at McMaster University, specializing in spatio-temporal
health geography. He believes that by integrating the disciplines of
`GIS` and `data science` together can develop more effective
decision-making processes and predictions including Mozilla's Internet
challenge.

**Charles Burke** (*Advisor & co-designer*): Tenured-track professor at
National Singapore University, whom specializes in multi-quantitative
analyses and `network theory`. His academic background includes
Environmental Sciences (Bishop's University), Political Science (U. of
Windsor), and transportation geography (McMaster U.).

Problem Statement
=================

Despite the differences between the two challenges, we (**Team
Akrinet**) noticed both intertwine to one another. Therefore, our team
aims to design and develop a universal system that tackles the off-grid
Internet and smart community networks challenge at the same time.

Solution Statement
==================

Users
=====

Technically, everyone living in the same environment would be (directly
& indirectly) affected by the proposed design. However to keep it more
simple, we target specific users whom have **at least one of the
following criteria**:

-   Low socioeconomic status
-   Reside in difficult, isolated, and/or hazardous geographic zones
-   Monopolized internet service providers

Community Location
==================

There are countless communities that'd be deem fit to the listed
criteria, such as the South Bronx, Saguache County (Colorado), and
Appalachian regions. However, rather than picking those examples,
instead we believe that **`Puerto Rico`** is the perfect location to
implement our design as it is currently in near humanitarian crisis from
the Hurricanes.

Puerto Rico
-----------

Puerto Rico is a US territory located in the Caribbean with a population
of 3.4 million people. After Hurricane Irma and Maria hit, most of the
territory (&gt;85%) has been without electricity for at least 19 days.
Without electricity indicates loss of telecommunications and direct
access to clean water. Reasons why its been painstaking slow to bring
back power are due to outdated grid, "brain drain", bankrupt government,
and its geography (isolation from the mainland and rough terrain).
Telecos are trying to restore back including Google via Alphabet and
Facebook sending in Loon balloons to bring LTE; however, these are very
limited and very short term. Wired commented that this would be an
opportunity to start from scratch and develop futuristic telecom
network.

Scalability
===========

Openness
========

There are countless of resources to showcase our design to the general
public. For professional and development purposes, we decide to share
our progress through three different types of mediums - Github (download
& update), Esri's StoryMap (story telling), and Shiny App IO
(interactivity). **`Github`** is quite popular on the web with the
proper format to display and update documentation. Additionally, it
fosters a professional social networking atmosphere.
**`Esri's StoryMap`** has aesthetically pleasing templates to build on a
story of the project and display geospatial data on maps, which we
intend to use. **`Shiny App IO`** via RStudio is somewhat simple, yet
very powerful for the audience to interact with our beta design.
