# Off-the-Grid Internet Challenge

How can we leverage wireless technology to keep people connected to each other and to vital information sources in the aftermath of a disaster where Internet access is unavailable or compromised?

The Off-the-Grid Internet Challenge seeks solutions that can provide connectivity in one of the most challenging situations: the immediate aftermath of a major disaster. When disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis and hurricanes strike, communications networks are often among the first pieces of critical infrastructure to overload or fail, leaving individuals disconnected from one another and from essential services and communications. With a total of $1M in prize money, the Off-the-Grid Internet Challenge seeks solutions that help individuals wirelessly access each other and information services like maps and messaging following a disaster.

## Our Problem Statement
With stable infrastructure and poor communications outages from disasters, gathering information will be difficult further exacerbating the damage and loss of lives. Time is of the essence; without a concrete plan and solution to address the people affected by the disaster, responses are restricted to decisions made on the fly. More often than not, strategies to overcome these issues usually act as damage control serving as last minute efforts to salvage whatever can be saved. 

## Our Solution Statement 
Our solution consists of 3 parts: Named Data Networking (NDN), modified routers, and a networking logistics tool. NDN, a development in network protocols, is key to our project. Providing enhanced security and faster browsing speeds over the existing TCP/IP protocol, it will achieve quick and reliable online access. The hardware leverages a low cost router to run NDN and establish a mesh-network on the fly. It will also include a battery to operate it. 

## Users
Telecommunication technologies has expanded quickly in the last decade as seen with the rise of 3G, 4G, LTE, free wireless zones, and the potential upcoming 5G network. However, many don’t realize how these telecommunications operate taking for granted our constant access to the rest of the world. The US has one of the most Internet cable connections in the world, leaving it virtually impossible for attackers to shutdown the entire country in a series of coordinated events. Though, the network is still vulnerable to smaller scale (i.e. Northeast) blackouts by accidental forces (i.e. car crashing into a telepole), unlikely but possible EMP attacks from adversaries, and especially natural disasters. This can pose a security problem and with little information to resolve affected areas, government agencies could be diverting relief sources ineffectively; thus, slowing down resolvement and putting civilians at greater risk. Therefore, the intent users applies to everyone, particularly those of low socioeconomic status, residing in high vulnerable zones (i.e. floodplains), and/or in active disaster zones (i.e. Puerto Rico). This solutions also covers cases with concerns regarding censorship and internet shutdown. 

## Community / Location 
From earthquakes to blizzards to tornadoes and hurricanes, the United States has a wide range of natural disasters that can cost municipalities millions, occasionally billions of dollars, to rebuild. Depending on the impact of the natural disaster, repairing infrastructure (electricity and internet) can take a mere few hours to days, and sometimes weeks (i.e. 2009 Northeast Ice Storm). This can be found in many parts across the country; however, we decide to narrow down areas that are either currently damaged or very prone to high impact disasters (i.e. California). With that, we believe that Puerto Rico is the perfect location to implement our design due to its current state. Nearly two months since Hurricane Irma and Maria plowed through Puerto Rico, 70% of the island’s 3.4 million people (40% are poor) is still left without electricity, which includes no access to telecommunications and clean water. This leaves the territory in a major humanitarian crises. Reasons why it’s been painstaking slow to bring back power are due to outdated grid, "brain drain", bankrupt government, and its geography (isolated from the mainland and rough terrain). With that, this is an opportunity for us to apply an off-grid, robust telecom network.
