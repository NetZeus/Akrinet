# Off-the-Grid Internet Challenge

How can we leverage wireless technology to keep people connected to each other and to vital information sources in the aftermath of a disaster where Internet access is unavailable or compromised?

The Off-the-Grid Internet Challenge seeks solutions that can provide connectivity in one of the most challenging situations: the immediate aftermath of a major disaster. When disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis and hurricanes strike, communications networks are often among the first pieces of critical infrastructure to overload or fail, leaving individuals disconnected from one another and from essential services and communications. With a total of $1M in prize money, the Off-the-Grid Internet Challenge seeks solutions that help individuals wirelessly access each other and information services like maps and messaging following a disaster.

## Our Problem Statement
With stable infrastructure and poor communications outages from disasters, gathering information will be difficult further exacerbating the damage and loss of lives. Time is of the essence; without a concrete plan and solution to address the people affected by the disaster, responses are restricted to decisions made on the fly. More often than not, strategies to overcome these issues usually act as damage control serving as last minute efforts to salvage whatever can be saved. 

## Our Solution Statement 
Our solution consists of 3 parts: Named Data Networking (NDN), modified routers, and a networking logistics tool. NDN, a development in network protocols, is key to our project. Providing enhanced security and faster browsing speeds over the existing TCP/IP protocol, it will achieve quick and reliable online access. The hardware leverages a low cost router to run NDN and establish a mesh-network on the fly. It will also include a battery to operate it. 

## Users
Telecommunication technologies has expanded quickly in the last decade as seen with the rise of 3G, 4G, LTE, free wireless zones, and the potential upcoming 5G network. However, many don’t realize how these telecommunications operate taking for granted our constant access to the rest of the world. The US has one of the most Internet cable connections in the world, leaving it virtually impossible for attackers to shutdown the entire country in a series of coordinated events. Though, the network is still vulnerable to smaller scale (i.e. Northeast) blackouts by accidental forces (i.e. car crashing into a telepole), unlikely but possible EMP attacks from adversaries, and especially natural disasters. This can pose a security problem and with little information to resolve affected areas, government agencies could be diverting relief sources ineffectively; thus, slowing down resolvement and putting civilians at greater risk. Therefore, the intent users applies to everyone, particularly those of low socioeconomic status, residing in high vulnerable zones (i.e. floodplains), and/or in active disaster zones (i.e. Puerto Rico). This solutions also covers cases with concerns regarding censorship and internet shutdown. 

## Community / Location 
From earthquakes to blizzards to tornadoes and hurricanes, the United States has a wide range of natural disasters that can cost municipalities millions, occasionally billions of dollars, to rebuild. Depending on the impact of the natural disaster, repairing infrastructure (electricity and internet) can take a mere few hours to days, and sometimes weeks (i.e. 2009 Northeast Ice Storm). This can be found in many parts across the country; however, we decide to narrow down areas that are either currently damaged or very prone to high impact disasters (i.e. California). With that, we believe that Puerto Rico is the perfect location to implement our design due to its current state. Nearly two months since Hurricane Irma and Maria plowed through Puerto Rico, 70% of the island’s 3.4 million people (40% are poor) is still left without electricity, which includes no access to telecommunications and clean water. This leaves the territory in a major humanitarian crises. Reasons why it’s been painstaking slow to bring back power are due to outdated grid, "brain drain", bankrupt government, and its geography (isolated from the mainland and rough terrain). With that, this is an opportunity for us to apply an off-grid, robust telecom network. 

## Technical Feasibility

Our solution tackles off-grid and disaster recovery using a prevention first mindset. Buildings have fire extinguishers, medical kits, and AEDs for emergencies to prevent issues from getting worse rather than treating them in the aftermath. We envision that under dire circumstances people use our product to power their devices and establish an off-grid internet.

The physical product is essentially a box containing a router, small computer, power supply, antennae, and backup battery supply. We call our box ANTs (Alternative Network Transmission boxes). This will be our greatest technical hurdle as it requires much research and design to ensure maximized value in addition to overhead of testing hardware. To ensure continued internet access and notifications of blackouts, the ANT comes with a backup battery providing extra hours of power. ANTs can also connect with other ANTs forming a mesh network which can behave as a community based Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP) on the fly. ANTs can serve as a router for homes/ buildings, however, we imagine that people will especially purchase them for insurance against disasters. Powering ANTs to run outside of homes will likely require plugging onto a nearby source of electricity (whether by on or off grid means). Manufacturing the case with aluminum will allow for cost effective, lightweight, and durable properties. Size will be somewhere between a WiFi router and a small shoebox.

Currently, research into desirable budget hardware running secure communications and NDN is being conducted. We are compiling a database of routing and processing hardware with information about performance, listings of supported software, cost, weight, and dimensions. With this information tradeoffs can be assessed finding the overall best value. The Raspberry Pi 3 (RPI3) is our current choice given its community support, hardware extendability, and security as it runs mainline Linux. It’ll also allow for logging internet speeds to determine sources of slowdowns/bottlenecking of the connection. Most importantly, the RPI3 can flash DD-WRT, OpenWRT, and the code running the NDN platform. Thus, removing the need of a router altogether provided the appropriate hardware is connected. The device will likely also sport 3 antenna ports to interface for different communications, notably; WiFi and 4G/ Cellular. 

With time being of the essence and an absence of infrastructure, it is critical for the item to be lightweight, portable, durable, and accessible to many from a reasonable range. Additionally, it must overcome data congestion issues prevalent in disasters. Additionally, it must be able to transmit data quickly, resiliently, and, if possible, in a fault tolerant manner to prevent the loss of the data/ messages. While existing P2P/ wireless mesh networks address the issue of maintaining a network, they often fall behind in range, speed, and reliability. Our solution covers the hardware constraints and concerns of range. To address issues concerning speed, resiliency, and fault tolerance, NDN will run on ANT. NDN is an internet architecture that promotes reusing TCP/IP's successful components while addressing its' shortcomings. One of the most significant changes is addressing content by name rather than by address. Requests are made by searching for cached content on the network, which are encrypted and tagged, and retrieves the content from the closest source. This prevents making a cross-country/global trip to get content and fetches it from the nearest source caching it instead. This allows access speeds to increase given that it cuts down on the distance and logistics of fetching content. There is a dedicated community, codebase, and investment from the NSF which makes this technology very attractive for this project as well as the future of the internet itself.

Assessing effective strategies for resilient communication in various off-grid scenarios will need a comprehensive system covering the constraints of each unique community. Network logistics will maximize communication potential by recommending strategies by simulating communications fault tolerance in the respective area. Our simulation primarily focuses on geospatial, internet infrastructure, and commercial/ industry as well as nonprofit presence data. These features will be downloaded from open source venues and collected from sites for the sole purpose of research. In the long term, we desire to create an internet/ communications resiliency alliance program to form strategic partnerships with governments, industry, non-profits, and other institutions to evenly distribute the ANTs in preparation.
