# Off-the-Grid Internet Challenge

How can we leverage wireless technology to keep people connected to each other and to vital information sources in the aftermath of a disaster where Internet access is unavailable or compromised?

The Off-the-Grid Internet Challenge seeks solutions that can provide connectivity in one of the most challenging situations: the immediate aftermath of a major disaster. When disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis and hurricanes strike, communications networks are often among the first pieces of critical infrastructure to overload or fail, leaving individuals disconnected from one another and from essential services and communications. With a total of $1M in prize money, the Off-the-Grid Internet Challenge seeks solutions that help individuals wirelessly access each other and information services like maps and messaging following a disaster.

## Our Problem Statement
With stable infrastructure and poor communications outages from disasters, gathering information will be difficult further exacerbating the damage and loss of lives. Time is of the essence; without a concrete plan and solution to address the people affected by the disaster, responses are restricted to decisions made on the fly. More often than not, strategies to overcome these issues usually act as damage control serving as last minute efforts to salvage whatever can be saved. 

## Our Solution Statement 


## Users
Like access to electricity and indoor plumbing, broadband Internet should be seen as a utility necessity. However, 34 million Americans lack access to quality Internet (of which **23 million** do not have access to broadband) due to various reasons.

Our off-grid Internet design fulfills this gap by tailoring it to those with low quality or no access. It’s likely that this group has at __least one of the following characteristics__: 

        1) Low socioeconomic status (<= Federal Poverty Line) 
        2) Reside in difficult, isolated, or hazardous geographic zones
        3) Have between 1–2 Internet service providers (ISPs)
        4) Low education level. 

Income may be the most transparent factor as it correlates to the geographic variations of the amount of ISPs and education level. Currently, **80 – 90% of the most affluent** households in the United States have Internet at home, in contrast to **50% of the those with the lowest median income**. With that, our team will target rural communities as poverty and disability rates are higher than urban areas. Additionally they have less physical and financial access to resources, which translates to very few ISPs; thus, a lack of competition leads to overpriced and poor quality of services. 1 in 3 have only 1 ISP and majority of the rest have only 2 [].

## Community / Location 
Numerous communities fit the listed characteristics from the “Users” section. Our focus will be on areas that match all three characteristics. __They include__: 

    1) those within the state borders of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas
    2) West Virginia
    3) Southern Texas
    4) Northern Maine

These have clusters of high poverty rates with monopolized ISPs and in isolated geographic areas. Rural Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi consist a mix of cultivated agricultural, bayous, and water bodies. West Virginia hugs onto the Appalachian mountains. Southern Texas is isolated from the major cities (i.e. Houston, San Antonio) with a mix of shrub and grass land cover. In Northern Maine, we are incorporating Aroostook County and the unorganized territory since they are sparsely populated areas. Aroostook County has 68,000 people with an area larger than Connecticut and Rhode Island combined. On another note, its’ more remote cousin with no name - unorganized territory of Maine - has a population of only 8000 with an area larger than Maryland. These areas cover a diverse set of constraints especially with respect to geographical, meteorological, and population density concerns.
